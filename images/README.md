Place the original OneNote attachment images here and name them as follows so the Markdown file links work:

- `figure1.png` — schematic showing assessed-ome → raw omics data → processed omics data (first image)
- `figure2.png` — zoom or copy of the same schematic (second image)

If you have PNG/JPG/WEBP files, simply copy them into this directory and rename accordingly. If you prefer different filenames, update the image links in `Week1_Working_with_Omics_Data_Poinsignon2023.md` accordingly.
